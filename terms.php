                    <p>The following form the Hire Contract and should be read in conjunction with the quotation/order confirmation document.</p>
                    <p>A quotation remains open for acceptance until the date stated on it or in the absence of such a date, 30 days from the date of issue. A quotation must be accepted in writing. Butterflies reserves the right to substitute a suitable alternative to any item ordered. The details of an order must be finalised not less than five business days prior to the event. Orders cancelled, in whole or part, within the five day period will still be charged to the client. <strong>Please note, place setting crockery and cutlery should be ordered in quantities which are multiples of ten.</strong></p>
                    <p>Supervision of delivery and collection of goods is essential. No hire equipment will be left at a delivery address unless a representative for the hirer is present to count the equipment delivered and sign the delivery note to accept the goods. Upon delivery of goods they become the hirer&rsquo;s responsibility and are held at the hirer&rsquo;s own risk (risk for the goods is only assumed by Butterflies at the time when they are safely secured in the collection vehicle). The hirer will be asked to check the order and sign for the goods which have been delivered.</p>
                    <p>It is a condition of the Hire Contract that the quantity of the hired items deemed returned off hire shall be determined solely by Butterflies&rsquo; staff once the items have been through the cleaning and inspection processes at Butterflies&rsquo; premises. The details of the count will be recorded and made available to the customer on request. The hirer is responsible for all breakages and losses and will be required to compensate Butterflies for the cost of replacement. Any damage to equipment will be charged at the full repair or replacement cost.</p>
                    <p>The hirer is responsible for returning to Butterflies any goods found to be remaining at the hirer&rsquo;s premises or function venue after the collection vehicle has departed (at the hirer&rsquo;s own cost). Such items will remain on hire until such time as they are returned and, failing their return, the full replacement cost for the loss will be charged to the hirer.</p>
                    <p>Charges are based on one standard hire period, longer periods will be charged as follows:</p>
                    <table cellspacing="0">
                      <tr>
                          <td>Weekend hire:</td>
                          <td>One standard hire</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td>Up to one week:</td>
                          <td>Two standard hires</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td>More than one week:</td>
                          <td>Price on request</td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>All hire equipment remains the property of Butterflies throughout the hire period which commences from the time of delivery and terminates at the time of collection. Collection of the hire items is deemed to be the time when they are safely secured in the collection vehicle. All items on hire should only be used for their intended purpose. All cartons, boxes and packaging materials remain the property of Butterflies and are to be returned at the end of the hire period and loss, damage or breakage of these items will result in the hirer being required to compensate Butterflies for the cost of replacement.</p>
                    <p>A small delivery change will be included in the order. Deliveries and collections which are required outside normal working hours (09.00 hours &ndash; 17.00 hours Monday &ndash; Friday) will attract an additional charge dependent on time, day and area.</p>
                    <p>A deposit will be held against loss, damage or breakage of goods. The minimum deposit is &pound;25.00 which is refundable once goods have been returned to Butterflies&rsquo; warehouse, counted and checked for damage. The deposit will be returned when the hirer&rsquo;s payment has cleared the Butterflies&rsquo; bank account and any adjustment for loss, damage or breakage has been made. When payment is made by either debit or credit card, the payment will be returned in the same way after adjustment for any loss or damage to goods. For a cash transaction, the deposit will be returned by business cheque. Where the customer has paid by debit or credit card and the loss or breakage deposit proves to be insufficient to cover the loss compensation charges, Butterflies is authorised to use the debit or credit card details to recover the additional charge without recourse to the customer. <strong>Customers who prefer to pay by credit card will incur an additional 2.5% handling charge for this facility.</strong> Payment by debit card does not incur a handling charge.</p>
                    <p>If we are unable to perform our obligations to you (or able to perform them only at unreasonable cost) because of circumstances beyond our control, we may cancel or suspend any of our obligations to you, without liability. Examples of those circumstances include act of God, accident, explosion, war, terrorism, fire, flood, extreme weather conditions, transport delays, strikes and other industrial disputes and difficulty in obtaining supplies.</p>
                    <p><strong>All orders must be paid for in advance of delivery, failure to do so will result in your order not being released for delivery.</strong></p>
                    <p>Where monthly account facilities have been granted, all invoices must be paid in full within 30 days of the date of invoice. Account customers who do not pay their account within the 30-day period will not be supplied with hire goods until their account is up to date. Late payment by any customer will attract an interest charge of 8% pa above bank base rate.</p>
                    <p>Hire charges are inclusive of our washing up service; however, it is necessary that all hirers remove excess food and liquids from the crockery, cutlery and glassware prior to the return of the goods.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing Terms and Conditions of Hire are deemed acceptable by the hirer unless stated in writing to Butterflies within seven days of receipt of Order Confirmation.</p>
                    <p>All prices are exclusive of VAT at the current rate.</p>
